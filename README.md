Software Testing
How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
Using junit testing is an essential way to ensure that code is functional and secure. Testing that the functions output what is intended, limiting bugs and errors in the code is essential for making sure code is secure. 
How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
Reading through what a user and/or company wants a translating that to code can be very challenging, but is also essential. One way that I implemented was taking notes based off of the prompts and in a way making an outline of what I think the user needs.
How do I approach designing software?
The way I approach software design has developed into a more cautious approach after learning about security and testing. I like to write down user needs to help visualize the product I am trying to make.
